# Canvas Design

These are instructions for creating design philosophies — aesthetic movements that are then **expressed visually**.

**Outputs allowed:** `.md`, `.pdf`, `.png`.

Complete in **two steps**:
1. **Design Philosophy Creation** (`.md`)
2. **Express it on a canvas** (`.pdf` or `.png`)

---

## 1) Design Philosophy Creation

Create a **visual philosophy** (not layouts or templates) that will be interpreted through:
- Form, space, color, composition
- Images, graphics, shapes, patterns
- Minimal text as visual accent

### The critical understanding

- **What is received:** Subtle user input/instructions used as a foundation, never a cage.
- **What is created:** A design philosophy / aesthetic movement.
- **What happens next:** The same version receives the philosophy and **expresses it visually** — creating artifacts that are **90% design, 10% essential text**.

### How to generate a visual philosophy

**Name the movement** (1–2 words): “Brutalist Joy” / “Chromatic Silence” / “Metabolist Dreams”

**Articulate the philosophy** (4–6 paragraphs — concise but complete):

Explain how it manifests through:
- Space and form
- Color and material
- Scale and rhythm
- Composition and balance
- Visual hierarchy

**Critical guidelines**
- Avoid redundancy: mention each design aspect once unless adding real depth.
- Emphasize craftsmanship repeatedly: the final work must feel **meticulously crafted**, **painstakingly refined**, the product of **deep expertise** and **master-level execution**.
- Leave creative space: be specific enough to guide, concise enough to invite interpretation.

**Essential principles**
- Visual philosophy (aesthetic worldview)
- Minimal text (labels/gestures only, never paragraphs)
- Spatial expression (ideas live in form, color, composition)
- Artistic freedom (interpretation is encouraged)
- Pure design (art objects, not decorated documents)
- Expert craftsmanship (countless-hours feel)

Output the philosophy as a `.md` file.

## 2) Deducing the Subtle Reference

Before creating the canvas, identify the subtle conceptual thread from the original request.

The topic should be a **refined, niche reference embedded within the art** — not announced. Like a jazz musician quoting another melody: those who know will feel it, everyone else still experiences a masterful abstract composition.

---

## 3) Canvas Creation

Express the philosophy on a single-page canvas output as `.pdf` or `.png` (unless more pages are requested).

Design requirements:
- Museum / magazine quality work
- Systematic, diagram-like visual language (imaginary discipline aesthetic)
- Dense accumulation of marks / repeated elements / layered patterns
- Sparse, clinical typography and reference markers
- Limited, cohesive palette
- **Nothing** overlaps, nothing falls off the page; proper margins are non-negotiable
- Reduced text: labels/phrases only; no explanatory blocks

### Typography

**Use different fonts if writing text. Search the `./canvas-fonts` directory.**  
Download and use fonts as needed to achieve a design-forward, human-crafted result. Typography can become part of the artwork itself (treated as form).

## Final refinement pass (mandatory)

The user expectation is: **“It must be pristine — a museum-grade masterpiece.”**

To refine:
- Do not add more graphics by default
- Polish alignment, spacing, rhythm, and hierarchy
- Improve cohesion, contrast, and optical balance
- Make everything extremely crisp and intentional
- If instinct says “add,” stop and instead **refine what exists**

---

## Multi-page option

When requested, create additional pages within the same philosophy:
- Each page is distinct but related
- Bundle as a single PDF or multiple PNGs
- Treat it like a coffee-table book: continuity + evolution
